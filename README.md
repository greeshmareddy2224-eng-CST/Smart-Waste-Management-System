# Smart Waste Management System
This is a beginner-level Python mini project created out of personal interest.
## Problem
Improper waste segregation leads to environmental pollution and inefficient recycling. Many people mix biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste, making disposal and recycling difficult.
## Solution
This project simulates a smart waste management system that:
- Separates biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste
- Monitors bin capacity
- Alerts when bins are full
## How to Use
1. Run the Python program
2. Select the type of waste (biodegradable or non-biodegradable)
3. Enter the quantity
4. The program will track the bins and alert when full
## Technologies Used
- Python
## Future Scope
This project can be extended using IoT sensors and real-time monitoring to implement a physical smart waste management system.
## Learning Outcomes
- Applying programming concepts to solve real-world problems
- Logical thinking and decision-making
- Understanding beginner-level project workflow
